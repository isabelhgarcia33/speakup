# Speakup

![Speakup Application](http://nikym.org/img/speakup.gif "Speakup")

This JavaScript project searches the Google Civic API for government officials. Users enter their addresses which trigger AJAX requests to the API, returning their local, state and federal representatives. The contact information from this hash is then parsed and hyperlinked so users can tweet or email each representative directly from our website with preformatted, editable text. We utilize jQuery, API keys and an adapter for the API calls.
